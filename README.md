KDE Plasma r/unixporn dotfiles
Some things i used for my rice on r/unixporn:

#### The starship config file is just a modified ver of [this](https://gist.github.com/3ayazaya/d87c70c5f30a6e28f15dfc84ca95fc68) one

#### There's a chance that the neofetch ascii will not render properly. A fix i found for this: go to the *neofetch* file (the systemwide config). Locate the warning sign ascii(should be set in place for Qubes). Search for zero-width space character online and paste it Below the ascii art. Done
